The DITA Interchange Package (DXP) is used to create single-file (Zip-based) packages of DITA-based resources and their dependencies for ease of interchange and management. A DXP package uses a specialized DITA map to define the package manifest.

NOTE: Java code for creating DXP Zip packages from DITA maps is currently managed in the DITA for Publishers project here
on GitHub (http://www.dita4publishers.org). This project currently only has a design for the DXP manifest document.
